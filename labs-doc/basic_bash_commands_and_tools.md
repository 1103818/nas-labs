# Basic Bash Commands and Utilities
Whenever we are using a Linux-based operating system so we require some knowledge of Bash (Terminal in Linux) and its commands and utilities. In this guide we will be looking at some of the most used commands and utilities.

## Commands
1. `cd`: Change directory
2. `ls`: List directory contents
3. `mkdir`: Make directory
4. `rm`: Remove file or directory
5. `cp`: Copy file or directory
6. `mv`: Move or rename file or directory
7. `cat`: Concatenate and display files
8. `grep`: Search for a pattern in a file
9. `chmod`: Change file permissions
10. `sudo`: Run a command with superuser privileges

These are just few commands to start your journey and there is a lot to explore. Even you can extend these commands by using something known as `flags`. For example. `ls -l` to list directory contents with more information.

## Utilities
1. `nano`: A simple text editor that is easy to use and comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions.
2. `grep`: A command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.

Don't limit yourself with only these commands and utilities but go for learning new things that are available to do your work with ease.
